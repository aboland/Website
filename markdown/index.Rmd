Hi, I'm Aidan Boland, I currently work as a Data Architect at [Cubic Telecom](https://www.cubictelecom.com), a technology company who provide connected software for Internet of Things

My work focuses on building end to end machine learning solutions  within the analytics team at Cubic. 

Previously, I was a Senior Data Scientist at [Edge by Ascential](https://www.ascentialedge.com/) where I researched and implemented statistical and machine learning techniques in order to improve and automate processes within the company.

I was also an occasional lecturer in the [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.ucd.ie/mathstat/) in University College Dublin, where I lectured Introduction to Data Analytics which formed part of the Online Masters in Data Analytics.

## About Me

***

### Background

- Cubic Telecom  
I am currently a Data Architect at [Cubic Telecom](https://www.cubictelecom.com). My role focuses on researching and building machine learning solutions for the analytics team.
- Edge by Ascential (Clavis Insight)  (2016 - 2021)  
Clavis Insight were acquired by [Ascential](https://www.ascential.com/) in 2017, and rebranded as [Edge by Ascential](https://www.ascentialedge.com/) in 2018. I worked in Clavis Insight and subsequently Edge by Ascential from 2016 until 2021.
- Postdoc (2015/2016)  
I completed a year as a Post-doctoral researcher in the [Insight Center for Data Analytics](https://www.insight-centre.org/) at [UCD](http://www.ucd.ie/) with [Prof. Andrew Parnell](http://mathsci.ucd.ie/~parnell_a/). The project was in conjunction with [Clavis Insight](http://clavisinsight.com/) and focused on machine learning algorithms, in particular supervised and unsupervised text classification.
- PhD (2011 - 2015)  
I obtained my PhD from [University College Dublin](http://www.ucd.ie/) under the supervision of [Prof. Nial Friel](http://mathsci.ucd.ie/~nial/). My PhD research focused on using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to estimate intractable likelihoods for Gibbs random fields.

### Selected Presentations

- **[RSS 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBObjtl108)**  
In September 2020 I was invited to speak at the Royal Statistical Society annual conference.
I spoke about my work developing [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) dashboards.

- **[Young-ISA 2019](/docs/Young-ISA2019.html)**  
In October 2019 I was invited to speak at the inaugural Young-Irish Statistical Association meeting.  
I spoke about my work as a data scientist, and explored the evolving nature of job titles for statisticians/data scientists.

- **[EARL Boston 2017](/docs/EARL2017.pdf)**  
At the Enterprise Application of the R Language in Boston November 2017 I presented a case study on integrating R into a production environment. This was achieved by creating an API using the [plumber](https://www.rplumber.io/) R package.

### Teaching

- **2019-2020**  
In the Autumn trimester of the 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 academic year I lectured [Introduction to Data Analytics](https://sisweb.ucd.ie/usis/!W_HU_MENU.P_PUBLISH?p_tag=MODULE&MODULE=STAT40720&MAJR=F084) which forms part of the [Online MSc in Data Analytics](https://sisweb.ucd.ie/usis/!W_HU_MENU.P_PUBLISH?p_tag=PROG&MAJR=F084) in the [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.ucd.ie/mathstat/) in University College Dublin.  
In the first half of 2019 I delivered lectures for the [Data Analysis for Decision Makers](https://sisweb.ucd.ie/usis/!W_HU_MENU.P_PUBLISH?p_tag=QMOD&MAJR=BSW1&MODULE=MIS10090) module in the [Lochlann Quinn School of Buisness](http://www.ucd.ie/quinn/) in University College Dublin.  
- **2016**  
I previously lectured an introductory statistical module [(Practical Statistics)](https://sisweb.ucd.ie/usis/w_sm_web_inf_viewer_banner.show_module?p_subj=STAT&p_crse=10050) in [UCD](http://www.ucd.ie/). Topics covered included calculating summary statistics, graphs,  basic probability theory, confidence intervals, [regression and correlation.](http://bayes2.ucd.ie:3838/aboland/STAT10050/) The students were also thought the basics of [Minitab](https://www.minitab.com/en-us/) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/).
- **2010-2015**  
I was a tutor in [UCD](http://www.ucd.ie/) from 2010 until 2015. Modules I covered included [Bayesian Statistics](https://sisweb.ucd.ie/usis/w_sm_web_inf_viewer_banner.show_module?p_subj=STAT&p_crse=40390), [Linear Models](https://sisweb.ucd.ie/usis/w_sm_web_inf_viewer_banner.show_module?p_subj=STAT&p_crse=30240), [Probability Theory](https://sisweb.ucd.ie/usis/w_sm_web_inf_viewer_banner.show_module?p_subj=STAT&p_crse=20110), [Time Series](https://sisweb.ucd.ie/usis/w_sm_web_inf_viewer_banner.show_module?p_subj=STAT&p_crse=30010), [Data Programming](https://sisweb.ucd.ie/usis/w_sm_web_inf_viewer_banner.show_module?p_subj=STAT&p_crse=40180) and [Actuarial Statistics](https://sisweb.ucd.ie/usis/w_sm_web_inf_viewer_banner.show_module?p_subj=STAT&p_crse=40160#bookmarkschedule).

### Publications

- **Efficient MCMC for Gibbs Random Fields using pre-computation (2018)**. [Electronic Journal of Statistics.](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ejs/1544670254)  
*Bayesian inference of Gibbs random fields (GRFs) is often referred to as a doubly intractable problem, since the likelihood function is intractable. The exploration of the posterior distribution of such models is typically carried out with a sophisticated Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, the exchange algorithm (Murray et al., 2006), which requires simulations from the likelihood function at each iteration. The purpose of this paper is to consider an approach to dramatically reduce this computational overhead. To this end we introduce a novel class of algorithms which use realizations of the GRF model, simulated offline, at locations specified by a grid that spans the parameter space. This strategy speeds up dramatically the posterior inference, as illustrated on several examples. However, using the pre-computed graphs introduces a noise in the MCMC algorithm, which is no longer exact. We study the theoretical behaviour of the resulting approximate MCMC algorithm and derive convergence bounds using a recent theoretical development on approximate MCMC methods.*  

- **Noisy Monte Carlo: Convergence of Markov chains with approximate transition kernels (2014)**. [Statistics and Computing.](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11222-014-9521-x)  
*Monte Carlo algorithms often aim to draw from a distribution $\pi$ by simulating a Markov chain with transition kernel $P$ such that $\pi$ is invariant under $P$. However, there are many situations for which it is impractical or impossible to draw from the transition kernel $P$. For instance, this is the case with massive datasets, where is it prohibitively expensive to calculate the likelihood and is also the case for intractable likelihood models arising from, for example, Gibbs random fields, such as those found in spatial statistics and network analysis. A natural approach in these cases is to replace $P$ by an approximation $\hat{P}$. Using theory from the stability of Markov chains we explore a variety of situations where it is possible to quantify how ‘close’ the chain given by the transition kernel $\hat{P}$ is to the chain given by $P$. We apply these results to several examples from spatial statistics and network analysis.*
